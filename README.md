# Hook-Pull-Reinstall-Restart

Sometimes you just want to run your app in your own home server and just keep it updated with as little effort as possible. I'd like to believe that _at least some_ apps _can_ run without Kubernetes and a convoluted CI-deployment pipeline.

This app runner

1. Pulls the latest changes
2. Installs all new dependencies
3. Runs the application
4. Listens to updates in your remote main branch and repeats

## Requirements

- Node 20.10 or later
- A cloned GitHub repository
- `package.json` file with a `start` script that runs your project
- A lockfile matching the `package.json`

## Get Started

First, go to https://smee.io/ and press the "Start a new channel" button. Make note of the URL provided.

Then create a new webhook for your GitHub project with that URL. (Repository > Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook). Make sure that

- The content type is `application/json`,
- A secret is set, and
- At least the `push` event is sent.

Finally, you can run the command `npx hook-pull-reinstall-restart`, and enter the smee.io channel URL when prompted:

```
> npx hook-pull-reinstall-restart
âœ” Start script â€º start
âœ” Do you have a Smee.io channel already? â€º Yes
âœ” Smee.io channel URL â€¦ https://smee.io/aBcDeF1234567890
âœ” Github webhook secret â€¦ myProjectSecret123
âœ” Main branch name â€¦ main
âœ” Save answers? â€¦ yes
âœ¨ Saving answers to /home/wolfie/dev/my-project/.hprrrc
```

_Technically it doesn't matter if this command matches whichever package manager you use for your project. But preferences are preferences, so feel free to use `yarn dlx` or `pnpm dlx` instead of `npx`._

After this, the branch will be pulled, newest project dependencies will be installed, and the project started.

```
âœ¨ [Smee] Connecting to https://smee.io/aBcDeF1234567890
âœ… [Smee] Connected

ðŸ”Š
ðŸ”Š  Done in 422ms
âœ¨ Running "echo "works""
âœ¨ Child process running on PID 36658
ðŸ”Š  works
```

If the webhook is set up correctly, the next time any updates happen in the main branch of your GitHub repository, the project will be killed, and everything will be restarted.

```

...and so on...
```

## CLI Options

```
--envs, -e
    Skip interactive prompts on startup and use environment variables instead
--prod, -p
    Omit devDependencies during package installation
--verbose, -v
    Increase logging
```

## Environment Variables

The environment variables used are:

- `EVENT_SOURCE_URL`: The HTTP(S) address to the (smee.io) service that sends the github webhook events
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: The [webhook's secret](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries#creating-a-secret-token) string
- `MAIN_BRANCH_NAME`: The name of the Git repository's main branch. This branch is what will trigger the cycle. Usually `master` or `main`.
- _(Optional)_ `START_SCRIPT`: The script in `package.json` to run when starting your app. If unset, defaults to "`start`".
- _(Optional)_ `AFTER_FIRST_SCRIPT`: The script in `package.json` to run after `START_SCRIPT` has executed for the first time (regardless of success or failure). If unset, no command is executed.

These values are written into `.hprrrc` by the interactive prompt if asked to. If the file exists, the script will use the values from there as defaults for environment variables (convenient with the `--envs` flag).

## Things of Note

The webhooks are proxied through a third party: [smee.io](https://smee.io/). I am not affiliated with them in any way, and I have no idea of what their data retention policies is. Best to assume that they will spy and mine your data as much as they can. That being said, [the data in GitHub's webhook events](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads) is not super expansive.

Also, if you choose to save the values when asked by the interactive prompt, your webhook secret will be saved in plaintext in a file called `.hprrrc`. So better not to reuse any known passwords.
